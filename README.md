## 👋 About Me

My name is **Thi Nguyen**. I am passionate about **cybersecurity** and **data analytics**, and I am committed to protecting people’s digital safety and privacy.

I recently completed both the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate** and the **Google Data Analytics Certificate**, where I gained hands-on experience with:

- Linux commands and file permissions  
- SQL queries and data filtering  
- Security audits and risk assessment  
- Data cleaning and data visualization using spreadsheets and tools like Tableau

I am currently preparing for the **CompTIA Security+** certification to deepen my knowledge of threat detection and incident response.

I have also contributed to a private cybersecurity website project for **CyberKelsy**, focusing on content, structure, and security awareness.

With a background in English teaching and fluency in **Vietnamese and English**, I bring strong communication skills and the ability to explain complex technical topics clearly to non-technical audiences.
